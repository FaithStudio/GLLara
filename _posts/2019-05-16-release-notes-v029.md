[Version 0.2.9](https://github.com/cochrane/GLLara/releases/tag/v0.2.9b) is out and ready for download.

The main change here is a fix for a bug that would freeze the entire application under some circumstances. Some annoying debug code is also finally disabled now.

A more basic change is that the app is now notarised by Apple, which means they checked it against known malware and decided it's clean. This is a requirement to install apps without trouble on future versions of macOS, but it's also generally a good habit.

There is one tiny new feature after all: You can now open model files by double-clicking or dragging them on the app icon. GLLara will then open a new document with that model file as the only content. This should make it easier to review new models that you downloaded.
